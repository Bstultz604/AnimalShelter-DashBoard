# AnimalShelter-DashBoard

# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Writting programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable requires a strong commitment to modularity and effective commenting. Creating modular logical methods provides a cleaner and more organized code base. Pairing this with well commented code ensures easy readability that promotes easy maintenance that can be adapted quickly. The work on the CRUD module exemplifies these principles. The use of the seperate file to connect the dashboard widgets to the database makes the logic of the file easy to read and maintain due to the lack of code clutter. This dedicated module can easily be adapted further to be used in other projects or to incorperate more functionality.    


 # How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
 
Approaching problems as a computer scientist is a multistep process. I approach problems first using first principles. Questioning my assumptions about the current problem helps clarify what sections of logic may be faulty or forgotten. After deducing where potential issues lay, I utilize documentation to check the validty of used properties. 


# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists help generete sophisticated logical solutions to unique issues. In this project I provided a user friendly interface that interacts with a database. The value from this comes in the ability the user is given to interact with the database to search and view potential animals for trsning purpose. Without the insights of computer science the data stored in the database stays locked in an relativly unusable state.
